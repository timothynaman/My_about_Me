# About Me ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

Italian son of immigrant, I understood the importance of looking for opportunities in differenct places and situations .I decided to study abroad to broaden my mind. While being in Italy I had the opportunity to work within the Fashion industry where I acknowledged the importance of data to drive growth. Realizing the power of data got me to pursue a master's degree in Business Analytics wich gave me the necessary tools to utilize data with confidence.
